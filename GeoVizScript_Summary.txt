GQ_VizScript

Description: 
Python script which takes a GeoQuery extract zip file as an input, and creates a well-styled choropleth map as an output.

This script should be callable from the command line, with three specified options at minimum (input and output file, column to visualize).

The file "output_example" is an example of what an output might look like after being processed by the script.
